# Description:
This program reads data from a text file and then will organize the data and store them into multiple text files based on the company name. The readData function will read the data from a text file and store the information into a vector. The getCompanies function will store the company names into a vector while ensuring that no duplicate names are stored as well. The printHighestPaid function finds the employee with the highest total pay and outputs their information to the screen. The separateAndSave function will read through the employees vector and write their information to a text file based on the company they work at (i.e. all employees who work at Intel will have their information written to a text file "Intex.txt").
